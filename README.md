# leetcode_submissions
All my leetcode submissions! You can copy them or read comments to learn why I did something the way I did.
I will be starting with "Easy Submissions" and working my way up!
The answers will always be in python 3. I don't use other languages currently to implement leetcode solutions.
You can submit them to see them work!
